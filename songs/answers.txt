Since "Audio Aura" represents the two most prominent moods of a listner, our
job thus reduces to finding them. I would look at the magnitude of each category,
and the two having the greatest or lowest magnitude would be the most prominent
moods of the listener. For instance, if the energy average was 0.2 and the
danceability was 100 this would then indicate the listener has a low energy yet
enjoys listening to danceable music. Note that we would require a way of having
control measurements through which the listeners analytics would be compared to.

Using only the top 100 songs from the past year might give inaccurate results as
we are using a very small sampple. A better way would be using all the songs
that the listener did listen no in the previous year. This way our final analytics
would have a much greater accuracy as we are using the entire avaialable data
rather than only a very small sample of such data.
