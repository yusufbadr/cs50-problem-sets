# CS50 Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard University's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course

The solutions may require the following tools:

- **C Compiler (for C problems)**  
  - A C compiler (e.g., GCC) is needed to compile and run C-based problem sets.
  
- **Python (for Python problems)**  
  - Python 3.x should be installed for solving Python-based problem sets.

- **Flask (for web development)**  
  - Install Flask for web-based problem sets. You can install Flask using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```

- **SQL Database (for SQL problems)**  
  - SQLite or any compatible SQL database should be set up for querying and interacting with databases.

## Repository Purpose and Overview

This repository contains solutions to CS50's Problem Sets for educational purposes. All solutions are based on the original course materials provided by Harvard University.

## Academic Honesty

This repository contains my personal solutions to the CS50 problem sets. It is important to note that academic integrity is essential. Please do not copy or submit any of these solutions as your own work. CS50 and many other institutions have strict policies against plagiarism, and copying solutions is a violation of academic honesty principles. I encourage you to attempt the problems yourself to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.
